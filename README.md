# Learning
This is a place of starter learning projects

# First off, glad you are starting to code.
 I am going to try and provide you some stuff that are specific to data managment and decision making around finTech and just generally stuff that will set you apart as an applicant. Learning how to code is priority No. 1 but I find the best way of doing that is through a project or two. 

 # Since you have a github now
 I think it would be wise to describe what github is.
 I Highly recomend reading this article but in my words, github is a storage and collaboration tool for writing code. plain and simple. this allows multiple people to work on code at the same time without the formatting annoyances of programs like google docs.

# first steps

Download python

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Python is a programming language, what you are downloading here is the necessary software that allows the code you write to talk to your computers CPU and other resources in order to run properly

Download VS code

https://code.visualstudio.com/download

VS code is a code editor. It allows you to open code files, edit, and run them all under the same piece of software. 


# Download git

this website looks sketchy, but little known is it that this really is what makes the world go round in the software world

https://git-scm.com/downloads 


# open up vs code

and hit terminal on the top of the window. this will take you to a baddass looking terminal from every hacker movie ever.
in this terminal you should navigate to your documents directory

help is here
https://wiki.communitydata.science/Windows_terminal_navigation 


in the terminal then paste this code and run it

git clone https://github.com/HudsonHurtig/Learning

this effectively downloads the directory to your folder and now you should be able to see in in your file explorer

open up this folder and 

# create your first piece of code

at this point you should open up VS code and create a new file

this file should be a python file so you can name it HaydenHelloWorld.py once you create this save it to this folder that this readme file is in

# code

write this in your first piece of code

print("Hello World")


there should be an arrow in the top right corner and you should hit that and see hellow world pop up in the console.

# congradulations! you did it! You are now a programmer.

There is no going back.
